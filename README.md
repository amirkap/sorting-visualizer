# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

This program, `sorting.py`, is designed to visualize some of the most well-known sorting algorithms using the `pygame` module. The visualization provides a graphical representation of how each sorting algorithm works, helping users better understand their mechanics.

## Supported Sorting Algorithms

The following sorting algorithms are currently implemented in the program:

- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pygame` module

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the `sorting.py` file.

2. Install the `pygame` module if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame

## Usage

Upon running the program, a graphical window will appear showing an array of elements in random order.

Press the following keys to configure the sorting:

**'B'**: Bubble Sort visualization

**'M'**: Merge Sort visualization

**'Q'**: Quick Sort visualization

**'H'**: Heap Sort visualization

**'A'**: Ascending sort

**'D'**: Descending sort



When done, press **'SPACE'** to start the sorting visualization. 

You can reset the array by pressing **'R'** before or after sorting.




Close the visualization window to exit the program.

## Credits

- This program was inspired by the need for interactive visualizations to understand sorting algorithms better.
- Thanks to the `pygame` library for providing an easy way to create graphical applications in Python.
